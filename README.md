# MiKasa Gallery

This is an example of web app written in React and backed by Nodejs (expressjs) to show a photo gallery.

It's used in combination with the [MiKasa project](https://github.com/mi-kasa/mikasa-home) to allow it to install it into your personal home gateway to create more distributed and selfhosted services.

This is the frontend used to watch the media synced in your gateway via the [MiKasa MediaSync](https://github.com/mi-kasa/mikasa-mediasync) and [Android Client for syncing photos](https://github.com/mi-kasa/android-media-sync)
